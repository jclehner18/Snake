# Snake Game
This is your standard snake game where you control a 'snake' and pick up fruit to increase in length and avoid hitting yourself and walls. 
This project uses an STM32L053 microcontroller, a knob, LED, and DOGS display. 
The display displays the game. The knob controls the snake direction. As more fruit is picked up, the LED gets brighter. 
Once the snake has reached a length of 20 a victory animation will display.
When you lose, a reset animation appears and you can play again.
